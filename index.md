## About Me

I am a researcher specializing in the use of FGK-type stars — spanning Sun-like stars to evolved red giants — to investigate nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of our galaxy. My work focuses on applying 3D non-LTE spectral modeling techniques to analyze stellar spectra. This approach enhances the accuracy of stellar parameters and chemical abundance determinations, which is crucial for large-scale stellar surveys such as 4MOST, where I am directly involved.

## Research Interests
- **Stellar Atmospheres:** Developing and applying 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to improve the accuracy of stellar parameters and abundance determinations.  
- **Stellar Spectroscopy:** Advancing 3D non-LTE spectroscopy tools and making these methods more accessible to the community.  
- **Galactic Chemical Evolution:** Using stars as tracers to study nucleosynthesis and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way.  
- **Computational Astrophysics:** Constructing grids of synthetic stellar spectra to support machine learning applications in stellar classification and analysis.  
- **Nucleosynthesis:** Investigating the production and distribution of key elements to refine models of stellar and galactic evolution.  
- **Atomic and Molecular Physics:** The foundation of spectroscopy — accurate atomic and molecular data enable us to extract reliable astrophysical insights!

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
